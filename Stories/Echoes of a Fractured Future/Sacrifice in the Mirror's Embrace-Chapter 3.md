# Chapter 1 – Sacrifice in the Mirror's Embrace

The silver-edged mirror hung like a veil between worlds, its surface shimmering with the faint echoes of a thousand forgotten souls. Elara's trembling fingers brushed the cold glass, her reflection winking back with a knowing smile that sent shivers down her spine. The ritual had begun: incantations whispered in a dead tongue, candles flickering in a pentagon of salt, and the pulsing scar on her palm—a mark of her pact with the mirror's entity.

The air thickened as shadows coalesced into a figure, its form shifting between predator and prey, whispering of a price unpaid since her last invocation. 'The balance demands a life,' it hissed, 'yours, or the boy's.' Elara's gaze flickered to the unconscious figure of Kael, his chest rising shallowly after their failed escape from the cathedral's collapsing spires. His life had always been collateral in her quest for forbidden knowledge.

The mirror's surface rippled, revealing a vision: Kael's still body in a crypt of ice, while she walked free, her mind sharp and unburdened. Then the reverse—a future where she cradled his head in her hands, their fates forever intertwined. The entity's laughter echoed like breaking glass. 'Choose, or both perish.' Her dagger trembled at her side, its blade reflecting not her face but a version of herself centuries older, skeletal and hollow-eyed—a glimpse of what service to the mirror would cost. In the silence, Kael coughed, his eyelids fluttering as he murmured her name. The mirror's edges began to crack, a countdown of frost spreading inward.

Elara lunged not at the dagger but into the glass, her body dissolving into starlight. The entity's scream was drowned by the sound of shattering crystal. When the dust settled, Kael stirred beside a single shard reflecting only emptiness, while miles away, a new figure emerged from a mirrored wardrobe in a stranger's house, her eyes holding the ghost of a decision made in a heartbeat—a sacrifice not of life, but of self, fracturing her existence into fragments scattered across time. The mirror, now inert, bore a single scratch: a name etched in silver, spelling 'ELARA' backward.
