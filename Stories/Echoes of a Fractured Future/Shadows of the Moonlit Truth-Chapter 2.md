# Shadows of the Moonlit Truth

The silver blade of the full moon sliced through the canopy, casting jagged shadows that writhed like serpents across the ancient stone archway. Kaela stood beneath it, her breath visible in the frost-bitten air, and pressed a trembling hand against the cold surface. The runes etched into the arch—a relic of the lost civilization her father had sworn to protect—glowed faintly, their light pulsing in rhythm with her racing heart. She had come here to prove the legends wrong, to dismiss the scholars' whispers of sentient monuments, but the arch's warmth beneath her palm defied reason.

A low hum resonated through the stones as she stepped inside, and the air thickened with the scent of damp earth and something metallic, like old blood. Shadows pooled in the corners of the chamber, twisting into shapes that seemed almost human. Her torchlight flickered, and for a heartbeat, she glimpsed a figure—a woman with obsidian skin and eyes like smoldering coals—before the image dissolved. "An illusion," she murmured, but her grip on the torch tightened. The walls here were alive with carvings: scenes of a battle between light and darkness, a queen kneeling before a tree with roots that drank the moon itself.

Deeper in the chamber, a pedestal held a cracked mirror, its glass reflecting not her face but a scene from elsewhere—a forest aflame under a blood-red moon. Kaela's throat tightened. This was no random vision; the flames mirrored the wildfires that had recently razed the northern provinces. A whisper slithered into her mind: _"They are coming."_ She spun around, but the chamber remained empty. Yet the sensation of being watched coiled around her like a second skin.

A cold draft swept through the chamber, extinguishing her torch. In the darkness, the carvings began to bleed luinescent sap, tracing a path toward the mirror. Kaela followed, her pulse a drumbeat in her ears. The sap pooled at the base of the mirror, and as she dipped her finger into it, the liquid solidified into a key. Her heart stalled. The key fit the crack in the mirror. With a breath, she turned it—and the glass shuddered, fragments spiraling outward to reveal not a reflection but a portal, swirling with a starless void. Beyond it, figures moved. Tall, skeletal, and crowned with crow feathers—they were the same as those in her nightmares since childhood.

"You were always meant to find this," hissed a voice from the void, echoing with a chorus of ancient tongues. Kaela stumbled back as a figure materialized before her: the shadow-woman from earlier, now solid and towering. "The truth you seek will unravel the world," she warned, "but the lies you fear have already devoured yours." The archway's entrance crumbled to dust behind Kaela, sealing her fate. She took a step toward the portal, the weight of a thousand hidden histories pressing on her shoulders, and wondered if the moon’s shadows had whispered to her, or if she had finally learned to listen.
