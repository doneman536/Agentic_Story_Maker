# Shadows of the Unseen

The air in the forest thickened as Elara stepped beneath the gnarled boughs of the Ancient Thorn, her boots crunching on frost-laced leaves. Above her, the canopy twisted into skeletal arches, filtering moonlight into jagged silver beams that spotlighted the path—a path she knew led deeper into forbidden territory. The Shadow Veil had whispered of this night, its voice a frigid breath against her neck: _'The unseen watches where the seen ends.'_

A flicker of movement caught her eye—a shadow detaching itself from the bark of a tree. It slithered downward, not as smoke nor substance, but as a rippling distortion, like heat above a wildfire. Elara’s dagger trembled in her grip. Legends spoke of the Wraithwoven, creatures born from the fears the Veil could not consume. This was no legend. The thing coiled, revealing a face—or what passed for one: a mosaic of hollow eyes and shifting features that echoed every face she’d ever known. 'Child of the Seen,' it hissed, voice threading through her mind, 'you tread where the Balance cracks.'

The forest itself began to warp. Trees leaned inward, roots snaking across the ground like hungry serpents. Elara stumbled back, but the Wraithwoven barred her path, its form now towering, its 'eyes' fixed on the pendant at her throat—the Shimmerstone, a relic of her clan’s lost lineage. 'You携 the key,' it crooned, 'yet you do not see the lock.' A cold realization struck her: the Veil’s warnings were not mere threats. Behind her, the trees creaked in unison, forming a wall. The Wraithwoven’s form dissolved into a hundred wisps, each murmuring her name—or was it their names? The first step of the Unseen’s game had just begun, and the shadows now had a new player to devour.
