Shadows of the Past


The ancient forest of Veythra had always been a tapestry of murmurs—wind through aspen leaves, the creak of ancient oaks, the rustle of creatures unseen. But today, those whispers sharpened into a cacophony of screams, as though the very trees recoiled from what Kael was about to uncover. His fingers pressed against the cold, lichen-slicked stone slab, feeling the faint ridges of forgotten runes beneath his touch. This was no ordinary burial site; the slab marked the sealed entrance to the地下 chamber where his father had vanished years before, a man who had died not by accident, but by design. 

The torch in his hand cast jagged shadows as he descended the spiral staircase, its steps worn smooth by time and the footsteps of those who’d come before. Each footfall echoed like a drumbeat, but the thuds behind him were not his own. His breath hitched as voices slithered through the tunnels—echoes of his own panicked thoughts, twisted by the cavern’s hollow acoustics into accusatory whispers. 'You should not be here,' the walls hissed, their words resonating in the marrow of his bones. He swallowed, the sweat on his neck cold and clammy, until reason—or perhaps desperation—ground the chaos into a semblance of clarity: it was his own breath, distorted into menace by the labyrinthine stone. 

The deeper he ventured, the thicker the air grew, cloying with the scent of mildew and something sharper, metallic, like blood old enough to have fossilized. In the center of the crypt lay the journal, its leather-bound spine cracked and frayed, open to a final entry stained by time and what might have been a desperate, final plea. *'They are not dead—they are waiting.'* The words blurred as Kael’s vision tunneled. A memory flashed—a vision not his own—of his father, not crumpled in a cave collapse, but standing defiant as a void coiled around him, a shadow with too many eyes, swallowing the man who had taught him to trust the stars. 

The ritual. The Council’s stories of preservation were lies. His father had been a jailer, not a scholar, and Kael’s recent excavation—a reckless excavation to prove his worth—had cracked the seal. The ground trembled as if the earth itself gasped. Crimson glyphs flared along the chamber floor, their light pooling like spilled wine. The walls groaned, splitting to reveal a monolithic door carved into the likeness of Lyrion, the ancient guardian whose legend had been tucked into childhood bedtime stories. The guardian’s eyes—two smoldering coals in a stone visage—locked onto Kael. '*You carry the blood of the oathbreaker,*' thundered a voice that vibrated in his skull, in his bones. Before he could falter, the entity’s tone fractured, splintered into the timbre of the only voice he’d ever known. '*Run,*' his father’s voice urged, '*You are not ready.*' 

Kael’s grip tightened on the dagger at his belt, its blade etched with runes that now pulsed like a sickened heart. The weapon’s weight was suddenly a lifeline, its inscribed glyphs glowing faintly as if recognizing the chaos it had been forged to combat. '*I am ready,*' he lied, the syllables tasting like ash. The door groaned open, revealing a figure cloaked in robes that seemed woven from twilight itself, its hooded silhouette radiating a presence both ancient and suffocating. '*The bloodline of the oathbreaker seeks me,*' it intoned, voice like wind through a graveyard. '*The shadows you’ve loosed will consume your world unless you choose: surrender to oblivion... or take this...' A shard of obsidian, slick with a liquid that shimmered like liquid night, hovered before him. '*The Labyrinth of Echoes awaits. There, you will face what you’ve buried.*' 

The shard burned his palm the moment he grasped it, not with heat, but with a coldness that seeped into his bones. Behind him, the chamber collapsed in on itself—stone and dust and the skeletal remains of forgotten sacrifices tumbling downward. The figure’s absence left a vacuum, but the chamber’s shadows now writhed like living things, fingers of darkness probing for flesh. A laugh echoed—not his father’s, but someone’s. Someone who knew. 

Kael’s hand clutched the journal, its pages now whispering secrets he’d never intended to hear. The shard’s surface reflected not his face, but a stranger’s—a boy who had believed in noble lies, now forced to confront the truth: his lineage was a chain, and the only key was a choice between annihilation or a labyrinth where his memories would dissect him. The forest’s screams faded into a low, malevolent hum, as if the earth itself was impatient. He tightened his grip on the shard and stepped forward, the first step toward a path paved with the bones of his certainty. The shadows at his heels did not falter, but they followed cautiously. Their patience had limits—and time was a luxury even the dead could no longer afford.
