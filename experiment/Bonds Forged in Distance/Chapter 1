The Unbreakable Bond


In the shadow of the Evernight Peaks, where the northern lights swirled like liquid amethyst and silver, the twin siblings Lila and Kael moved through their morning drills under the Whispering Grove’s ancient oaks. The trees, their bark etched with faint, glowing runes, seemed to sigh as the twins’ footsteps crunched over frost-bit leaves. Their fingers brushed the pendant at their throats—a single pendant, split between their necks by a silver chain. The relic’s runes pulsed faintly, their once-vibrant crimson gem now the ashen hue of old wounds. 'The bond is fading,' their grandfather’s words echoed in Lila’s mind, sharp as the bite of winter. She remembered the fear in his eyes that morning, the way he’d gripped her shoulder as if she might slip through his touch.

Lila’s sword swung wide, a steel arc meant to slice the air but instead trembling in her suddenly unresponsive hand. Her arm gave way, the blade clattering to the moss. Across the clearing, Kael staggered, one hand clutching his temple, the other gripping the hilt of his dagger as though to anchor himself to the world. The ground between them shuddered, and their family’s twin dagons—forged from star-forged steel, a symbol of their unity—ruptured the earth, their hilts pointing skyward as if pulled upward by some unseen hand. Roots cracked around the blades, their movement unnatural, hungry.

Elder Veyra found them at dusk, her iron-gray braid coiling like a cobra’s hood as she paced the forge’s embers. The air smelled of smelted iron and herbs; Lila’s nose wrinkled at the acrid tang of burnt sage. 'The Bloodline’s curse,' the elder croaked, her eyes reflecting the forge’s dying flames. 'Your bond was meant to anchor you to this realm, but the Eclipse draws near. Without the starlight draught, the Veil will tear, and what walks between the cracks will feast on your separation.' She thrust the vial into Kael’s hand—it shimmered like captured moonlight, swirling with threads of cobalt and gold. Kael’s knuckles whitened around it. 'Why us?' he demanded, voice tight. The elder’s silence was a stone dropped in water. 'Because you are both halves of a single flame,' she said. 'And flames, when split, burn hotter... or die.'

That night, the hearth’s glow flickered against the walls of their stone cottage. Lila traced the pendant’s dimming gem, her breath fogging in the chill. Kael’s voice wavered, barely above a whisper: 'What if the draught doesn’t work? What if we’re torn apart like the stories say—the ones where the twins become echoes, then ghosts, then just... nothing?' The pendant flared suddenly, not with light but a sickly green glow, and the walls seemed to shudder. Shadows in the room coiled like serpents, and a sound like rending cloth split the night—a sound that made the very air taste of rust. Beyond the village walls, a low, primordial growl reverberated, vibrating in their bones. It was a sound no one had heard in centuries: the call of the Firstborn, the ancient guardians—or perhaps jailers—of the Veil. 

Lila’s heart raced. The pendant’s faint pulse now mirrored the thrashing shadows, its light flickering like a dying star. Kael’s hand found hers, and for a heartbeat, the shadows stilled. 'We’re more than halves,' she said, her voice steady despite the terror in her chest. 'We’re the last ones who remember how to close the gate.' The twins stood, the pendant’s chain taut between them, as the first tendrils of twilight’s darkness seeped through the cracks in the cottage door. Somewhere in the peaks, the auroras dimmed, and the Firstborn’s growl became a laugh—a sound that spoke of endless hunger and the certainty of their coming trial. The pendant’s glow brightened again, a defiant spark against the creeping dark. They had six nights until the Eclipse. Six nights to hope their bond was more than a relic… and less than a prison.
