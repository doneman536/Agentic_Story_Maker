Whispers of Distance


The sun hung low over the Crimson Wastes, its amber light bleaching the dunes into a sea of ash. The air shimmered with heat, each step Kael took drawing a sharp gasp from lungs parched by the relentless wind. His boots left craters in the sand, which seared his soles like embers, while the dagger at his belt—a blade forged from a fallen star’s shard—grew unnervingly warm against his palm. Behind him, Lirien’s breath came in shallow bursts. Her silver hair, caught in the dying light, flickered like the last embers of a funeral pyre. She clutched the frayed edge of her cloak, its threads fraying into the desert, as though the very fabric of her presence was unraveling. The map etched into Kael’s dagger had led them this far, but its lines now writhed under his touch, inky trails dissolving and reforming like a serpent’s tongue. They were not merely lost; they were being rewritten by the land itself. 

The whispers began at dusk, threading through the silence like poisoned thread. They did not speak in words at first—only in the rasp of forgotten names, the creak of creaking timbers from phantom ships, and the faint, familiar cadence of his mother’s lullabies. To Kael, they were a blade at his throat, a voice he’d never heard but knew intimately: *Turn back. The path is sealed.* Lirien, however, pressed her ear to the sand, her eyes wide and unblinking. ‘They’re calling us,’ she murmured, voice steady but her fingers trembling around her staff. ‘The dead here—they’re not warnings. They’re *voices*.’ Her defiance rang hollow when, that night, the sand beneath their campsite erupted in glyphs. They clawed upward, glowing runes of gold and blood-red iron, spelling out fragments of stories Kael didn’t recognize: *‘Eowyn fell here. Her tears birthed a river of glass.’* Lirien’s own name flickered in one glyph, though she had never been here before. The ground burned beneath their feet until dawn, when the wastes reshaped themselves. 

Obsidian spires now thrust jaggedly skyward, their surfaces reflecting not the pair but a thousand ghostly echoes of travelers stalled mid-step. The air crackled with static, each breath tasting of ozone and burnt copper. Kael watched Lirien’s shadow stretch unnaturally toward the spires, her silhouette elongating into something spindled and unfamiliar. ‘The distance is alive,’ she whispered, but her voice carried a child’s awe mixed with dread. ‘It’s… *hungry*.’ Before Kael could reply, the earth split open with a sound like tearing silk. From the rift rose a figure, its body a shifting tapestry of memories: Kael’s first birthday—a cake crumbling into dust—his father’s funeral pyre, Lirien’s first spell flaring blue-white. Its face rearranged constantly, a mosaic of Kael’s life, its eyes twin voids where his own reflection stared back. ‘Songlines are not paths,’ it intoned, its voice the grind of tectonic plates, ‘but debts. To approach the spires, you must offer a memory that shaped you. A shard of the soul’s armor.’ 

Lirien’s staff blazed with cerulean fire, the light revealing the glyphs still scabbed on the sand, etching new warnings. The figure held up the mirrored shard. In it, Kael saw not his reflection but a vision: himself alone, the crown of thorns heavy in his grip, standing before a gate that led nowhere. Lirien’s defiance wavered. ‘What if the shard takes more than the memory?’ she asked, her staff trembling. The figure tilted its head, and Kael’s own laughter from a decade past echoed in the silence. The spires hummed, their peaks glowing like dying stars. 

Kael felt the weight of the dagger’s map, its lines now a labyrinth without exits. The ‘distance’ was a sentient trial, demanding sacrifice to permit passage. To falter here was not to die but to become a wraith, eternally whispering warnings to the unwary. Yet the alternative—surrendering a memory—might cost them their identities. Lirien’s staff flared brighter, a defiant beacon against the encroaching shadows. Ahead, the spires pulsed, as if breathing. The choice was clear: to press on was to become a part of the land’s lore, or to retreat and let the desert swallow them whole. The whispers crescendoed, a chorus of the doomed, weaving through the spires like a noose. Somewhere in the howling wind, Kael heard his mother’s voice—not in warning, but in a question: *What will you choose, little star?* The answer would decide whether they walked free or became the next whispers in the wastes’ eternal song.
