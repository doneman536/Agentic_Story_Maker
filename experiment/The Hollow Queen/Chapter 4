The Curse of the Hollow Queen


The air in the temple of Veythra hung heavy with the musk of centuries-old rot, the scent of damp earth mingling with the metallic tang of rusted relics. Elara’s torch swung as she moved, its light catching glyphs carved into the stone like scars—a tongue of forgotten sorcery that seemed to pulse faintly as she passed. Kael, his scaled fingers tracing the figure in the bas-relief, hissed the words like a curse: 'He severed her soul, you see? Not just from her body, but from time itself. She’s been here, trapped between realms, for a thousand years.' The queen’s image in the carving showed her sinking into a swirling abyss, her once-regal features contorted into a silent scream only the cracks in the stone could articulate.

The chamber beyond the arch felt alive, as if the very air strained against their presence. Crystalline pillars stretched skyward, their surfaces shimmering with trapped starlight, yet the floor was a mosaic of splintered crowns and bleached bones arranged in patterns too deliberate to be natural. At the center loomed the obsidian sarcophagus, its jagged fissures oozing silver fluid that dripped like tears. When Elara approached, the liquid pooled at her feet, twisting into the queen’s visage—not a reflection, but a wraith, her crown lopsided and jewels cracked. Her voice was a gong in their marrow: 'You reek of destiny.'

Kael’s staff blazed brighter as the queen’s form rippled, her features shifting between wrath and sorrow. 'Lysander was her shadow, her confidant,' he insisted, sweat dripping down his neck as the walls groaned. 'He stole the amulet, yes, but the texts say she loved him once. The betrayal… it turned her grief into this prison.' The queen’s outline flickered, a snarl splitting her spectral face. 'Blood of the traitor’s line walks with you,' she hissed, the glyphs erupting into crimson light. The sarcophagus roared open, tendrils of smoke-like shadow seizing Elara’s wrist. In the vision, Lysander’s face was a mask of desperation as he tore the amulet from her chest, the stone within blazing like a dying star. 'Dust,' he’d spat. 'You’ll never rule again.'

The chamber’s collapse began with a sound like grinding teeth. Kael’s staff erupted in a burst of cerulean light, shielding them as the floor gave way, but not before the queen’s skeletal finger jabbed at Elara’s scar—a birthmark now glowing like a brand. 'The mark binds you to her rage,' Kael choked, pulling her through crumbling arches. Outside, under a sky choked with ash, Elara’s reflection in a puddle revealed the scar’s silver sheen. The word 'Lysander' echoed in her skull, sharp as a blade. Somewhere, deep in the ruins, a new glyph formed in the stone: a crown entwined with a serpent, pulsing as if it, too, had just been cursed.
