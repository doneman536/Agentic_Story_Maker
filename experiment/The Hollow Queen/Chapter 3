Beneath the Porcelain Skin


The mirror above Lira’s vanity stood as both confidante and liar, its silvered glass reflecting a visage of icy perfection. Her skin, the color of freshly fallen snow, stretched taut over cheekbones carved by some god of austerity. But beneath that porcelain mask, the truth writhed. Three days earlier, the silver serpent’s venom had not been the end—it was a key turned in a lock she had not chosen. Now, her veins pulsed with a subterranean hum, like a hive of whispered secrets. She pressed a palm to her throat, feeling the cold current beneath her fingertips, a serpentine current that slithered upward, tracing the delicate curve of her wrist toward her heart. It left gooseflesh in its wake.

Moonlight bled through the stained-glass window, painting her in hues of cobalt and amethyst. In her hand, the teacup trembled—a Ming vase fragment gifted to her by her mother before the Collection’s purge. The chipped handle dug into her skin, but she held it to her lips, sipping the bitter brew. Her mother had once called this cup ‘a conversation with the past.’ Now, it tasted of copper and regret. As she drank, a flicker of movement caught her eye. A scale, no larger than a fingernail, swam in the liquid. Its edges shimmered with an otherworldly bioluminescence, casting shadows that writhed like eels across her face. The venom was not confined to her bloodstream; it was *communicating*. Her pulse quickened, not from fear, but from the primal recognition of a parasite awakening.

The door to her chambers splintered inward before the knock could finish. Kael stood in the threshold, his silhouette fractured by the hallway’s torchlight. His left eye—once a mirror of her own hazel gaze—now glowed like molten gold, slit-pupiled and predatory. Scales, obsidian and sharp, clawed through the skin of his neck, a jagged crown of betrayal. 'Father’s men are here,' he snarled, his voice a rasp of venom and static. 'They came with the cult’s sigils blazing. They’ll raze the manor to smoke before the sun rises.'

Lira’s chest tightened. The antidote—a promise forged in their father’s vault—had been a lie. She had drunk poison to survive, only to become a living cauldron for whatever the serpent had buried within her. The teacup in her hand began to weep. Cracks spiderwebbed across its surface, porcelain shards embedding into her flesh as the cup fused to her palm. Kael reached for her, his touch scalding yet urgent. 'They think the venom is a weapon,' he hissed, his scales rippling like living armor, 'but it’s a *door*. Something’s been feeding in there since the bite. It’s hungry for more than your blood.'

Beyond the window, the fog coiled thicker now, tendrils of mist coalescing into the shapes of serpents. The air reeked of myrrh and bloodroot—a scent that clung to Kael’s skin, to the dagger sheathed at his hip, to the lies that had festered between them for years. Lira stared at her reflection again, now splintered in the mirror’s cracks. Her lips curled into a sneer. The venom would not make her a monster alone. It would make her a host, a vessel for the serpent’s ancient hunger. And as the first cultist’s cry echoed through the halls, she tightened her grip on the fused teacup, its porcelain now fused to bone. The scales in her tea had begun to *move*.

The game had never been about survival. It had always been about awakening.
