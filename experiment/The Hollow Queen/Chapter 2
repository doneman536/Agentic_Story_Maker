Eyes in the Glass Darkly


The antique shop's dim light flickered, casting jagged shadows over the cluttered shelves, as Elara’s breath misted in the chill that clung to the air. Her fingertips grazed the mirror’s cracked glass, sending a shiver down her spine. The frame’s gilded vines writhed like living serpents under her touch, their leaves twisting toward her. Mr. Veyl, the shop’s gaunt proprietor, had leered at her from beneath a moth-eaten hat, his porcelain eyes—pale and veined with cracks like broken china—never blinking. 'A fine curiosity for a scholar,' he’d purred, though his accent was as sharp as the scent of mothballs that clung to him. But Elara knew better than to heed his assurances. The mirror’s coldness seeped into her bones, a malevolent hunger that made her think of Eiran’s still, lifeless face. *A gift for your brother*, she’d lied, her voice steady, though the truth gnawed at her: Eiran had been found in their shared lodgings, a thin trail of ash curling from his lips, whispering of *eyes that followed him* in a voice not his own. 

The glass reflected her face—pale as bone, her dark curls tangled from the dust—but when she leaned closer, the silver surface rippled like disturbed water. Her reflection’s lips moved first, soundless, before the eyes snapped open. Not her brown irises, but voids like swallowed stars, slit pupils like a predator’s in the dark. A cold laugh died in her throat as the glass drew her gaze deeper. The whisper returned, slick and ancient: *You’ll see what others cannot.* It wasn’t a promise. It was a command. 

That night, the mirror perched on her bureau, its surface clear save for a sliver of moonlight that ignited the hidden runes. Symbols coiled along the frame’s edges, glowing faintly in a tongue that coiled in her mind like a curse. She traced one rune, her grandmother’s forbidden grimoire flashing in her memory—*those who speak with the dead write in the language of the Veil*. The glass warmed under her palm, alive. Her reflection’s eyes flared gold this time, and the lips she tried to purse into *Eiran?* split into a wider grin. The mirror’s surface blurred, and the air thickened, sweet with decay. 

A draft swept through the room, carrying the tang of ozone and burnt myrrh. The spectral figure materialized behind her—a wisp of smoke and jagged bone, its head cocked at an impossible angle, eyes like shards of amber. She spun, but the room was silent, save for the mirror’s low, resonant hum. The glass now showed not her face, but a hall of endless mirrors, each pane hosting a pair of eyes that tracked her, unblinking. Their gaze burned into her skull as the mirror’s frame echoed with a hollow toll—*dum, dum, dum*—a dirge for a death not yet come. Her breath lodged in her throat as the first step toward the mirrored labyrinth beckoned, the path paved with questions only the dead now carried answers to.
