Whispers in the Workshop


The forge’s embers smoldered crimson and gold, casting long shadows that clawed at the walls like spectral fingers. Kael’s rough hands, calloused from decades of shaping steel, tightened the leather apron’s straps with deliberate slowness. His breath fogged the damp air—a reminder of the subterranean chill that clung to the workshop, a cavernous crypt buried beneath the Clocktower’s iron ribs. The nails embedded in the walls were not just tools, but relics: a claw hammer from the War of the Shattered Gears, a chisel that had carved the first cog of the Starwheel—a tool older than the city itself. All lay dormant now, their edges dulled by time, yet their presence pulsed with a latent hunger. 

The workshop thrummed tonight, but not with the rhythmic heartbeat of the Clocktower’s gears. This vibration was jagged, uneven, as though the machinery above had developed a fever. Kael’s boot scuffed the floor, and a sound escaped the cracks beneath—a hiss, half-mechanical, half-sentient—as if the ground itself were gasping. The bronze key in his pocket burned against his thigh, its serrated teeth biting deeper with every passing moment. He remembered the Archivist’s corpse, hollow-eyed and clutching a parchment that now fluttered in his satchel. *The Workshop lies in the whisper*, the man had gurgled, his voice swallowed by the abyss below the spire. A lie? A riddle? The question gnawed at Kael as he struck flint to the lamp. 

The light erupted, and the room exploded into a thousand faces. The walls were not stone but a mosaic of tiny mirrors, each reflecting a different iteration of Kael: a younger version, eyes bright with ambition; an older man, hair streaked with ash; and a shadowed figure he did not recognize, fingers curled around a blade of liquid silver. The whisper sharpened, now a serpent’s hiss in his ear, syllables elongated, vowels thick with malice. *Kael… Kael…* It swirled around the key in his pocket, as if the metal itself resonated with the voice. He swung the hammer, muscles taut, and struck the anvil. The clang echoed, but the noise died too quickly, leaving only a hollow silence. 

The vials shattered. Green fluid leaked like venom, eating into the floorboards with a sizzle. Where it pooled, a symbol burned into the wood: a key coiled by two serpents, their heads forming a crown. The walls began to shift, mirrors sliding like a living puzzle, rearranging into impossible angles. Kael stumbled back as his own reflection leered at him from a dozen directions, each version of himself mouthing different accusations. Behind him, the air shimmered. A shape took form—a silhouette draped in tattered robes, its face a void where a mirror should have been. The whispers crescendoed, now a chorus of a thousand voices. *'You unlocked the wrong door, blacksmith’s son. The Workshop is alive—and it remembers.'* The room narrowed, the mirrors closing in, and somewhere in the labyrinth, a laugh echoed, cold and metallic, as if the very walls had teeth.
